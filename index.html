                <h1>Mama Foreman's Kitchen</h1>
                    <p>
                        The first of this recipe was made homemade straight outta Mama Foreman's kitchen in 1963.
                        Mama Foreman's dish brought many together for years during this hard time for African-Americans in the US.
                        Mama Foreman had many recipes that would always bring smiles to everyone's face in her neighborhood.
                        Every dish was from a recipe that was passed down for many generations.
                        Years later the family opened up a small restaurant in the heart of Birmingham, AL: Mama Foreman's Kitchen.
                        Mama Foreman always had a <em>lil sumn sumn</em> that she put in every dish to make it "Mama's", but here we have the basics along with a one or two ingredients that made Mama's dishes stand out from the rest of the pack.
